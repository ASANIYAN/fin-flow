# Accessibility Compliance Guide

## Overview

FinFlow has been audited and enhanced to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, ensuring the application is fully accessible to users with disabilities, including screen reader users.

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure

- **Purpose**: Provides meaningful structure for assistive technologies
- **Implementation**: All major components use semantic HTML elements
- **Components Enhanced**:
  - Navigation uses `<nav>` with proper landmarks
  - Main content areas use `<main>` landmark
  - Headers use proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
  - Forms use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for grouping

### 2. ARIA Labels and Descriptions

- **Purpose**: Provides additional context for screen readers
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive ARIA attributes throughout the application
- **Key Areas**:
  - Form fields have `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and `aria-invalid`
  - Interactive elements have appropriate `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`
  - Live regions use `aria-live` for dynamic content updates
  - Tables have proper `scope` attributes and ARIA labeling

### 3. Keyboard Navigation Support

- **Purpose**: Enables navigation without a mouse
- **Implementation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Features**:
  - Tab order follows logical flow
  - Focus indicators are visible and high contrast
  - Skip links for main content and navigation
  - Custom keyboard event handlers where needed
  - Proper focus management in modals and forms

### 4. Screen Reader Compatibility

- **Purpose**: Ensures content is properly announced to screen readers
- **Implementation**: Screen reader optimized structure and labeling
- **Features**:
  - Hidden text for additional context (`sr-only` class)
  - Proper form field associations
  - Live announcements for state changes
  - Clear error messaging and validation feedback

### 5. Focus Management

- **Purpose**: Provides clear visual focus indicators
- **Implementation**: Enhanced focus styles throughout the application
- **Features**:
  - High contrast focus rings using brand colors
  - Focus trapping in modals and dialogs
  - Logical tab order in complex components
  - Programmatic focus management for dynamic content

## Component-Specific Enhancements

### Forms (Login, Signup, etc.)

- Fieldsets and legends for form sections
- Proper label associations with form fields
- Error messaging with ARIA describedby
- Required field indicators
- Accessible password visibility toggle
- Real-time validation feedback

### Data Tables

- Table region with descriptive ARIA label
- Column headers with proper scope
- Row and cell ARIA indexing
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly empty states

### Modals and Dialogs

- Alert dialog role for confirmations
- Focus trapping within modal content
- Proper ARIA labeling and descriptions
- Keyboard event handlers (Escape to close)
- Focus return to trigger element

### Pagination

- Navigation landmark with descriptive label
- Page number buttons with ARIA current
- Clear labeling for pagination controls
- Accessible rows per page selector
- Live region for pagination status

### Interactive Elements

- Descriptive button labels and ARIA attributes
- Loading states with screen reader announcements
- Error states with proper ARIA live regions
- Success feedback with appropriate announcements

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

- Components tested with accessibility linters
- ARIA attributes validated for correctness
- Semantic HTML structure verified

### Manual Testing

- Keyboard navigation tested across all components
- Screen reader compatibility verified
- Focus management tested in all interaction patterns
- Color contrast validated for all text elements

### Browser Compatibility

- Tested with major screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard navigation verified across browsers
- ARIA support tested in different environments

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Always use semantic HTML first** before adding ARIA attributes
2. **Test with keyboard navigation** - ensure all functionality is accessible
3. **Use the sr-only utility class** for screen reader specific content
4. **Provide descriptive labels** for all interactive elements
5. **Implement proper focus management** for dynamic content

### For Content Authors

1. **Use descriptive link text** - avoid "click here" or "read more"
2. **Provide alternative text** for images and icons
3. **Structure content with proper headings** - maintain hierarchy
4. **Write clear error messages** that explain how to fix issues

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut    | Action                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Tab         | Navigate to next interactive element     |
| Shift + Tab | Navigate to previous interactive element |
| Enter/Space | Activate buttons and links               |
| Escape      | Close modals and dropdowns               |
| Arrow Keys  | Navigate within menus and tables         |

## Screen Reader Support

The application has been tested and optimized for:

- **NVDA** (Windows)
- **JAWS** (Windows)
- **VoiceOver** (macOS/iOS)
- **TalkBack** (Android)

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance
